### Abstract:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients could not receive timely healthcare services due to limited access to hospital infrastructure and human resources. Previous studies found that access to intensive care unit (ICU) beds saves lives, but they overlooked the temporal dynamics in the availability of healthcare resources and COVID-19 cases. To fill this gap, our study investigated daily changes in ICU bed accessibility with an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. Along with the increased temporal granularity of measurements, we uncovered two phenomena: 1) aggravated spatial inequality of access during the pandemic and 2) the retrospective relationship between insufficient ICU bed accessibility and the high case-fatality ratio of COVID-19 in rural and suburban counties. Given our findings, we suggest that those locations should be supplemented with additional healthcare resources to save lives in future pandemic scenarios.
